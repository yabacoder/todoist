# react-lifecycles-compat

## What is this project?

React version 17 will deprecate several of the class component API lifecycles: `componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `componentWillUpdate`. (Read the [Update on Async rendering blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html) to learn more about why.) A couple of new lifecycles are also being added to better support [async rendering mode](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html).
